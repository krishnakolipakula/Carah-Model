# CARAH Model for Disease Prediction    
*Leveraging Weather Data for Agricultural Insights*  

This repository provides a high-level overview of a confidential project leveraging weather sensor data and machine learning to predict disease spread in crops. No code or sensitive data is included to maintain confidentiality.  


---

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning-based model designed to predict disease spread in crops using weather sensor data. The system processes multi-sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity) to identify critical patterns and calculate the potential infection severity over time.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Data Processing**: Preprocessed weather data with Python, cleaning and transforming raw data for effective analysis.  
- **Machine Learning**: Developed algorithms to calculate key metrics like humid periods and infection severity based on incubation curves.  
- **Visualization**: Generated interactive graphs using Plotly to display infection trends and severity flags for decision-making.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Tools**: Pandas, Plotly, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning**: Custom algorithms tailored to agricultural data processing and analysis

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Imported weather sensor data, applied filters to remove unnecessary columns, and created timestamp-based hourly insights.  
2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Generated key metrics like humid periods and average temperatures from multi-sensor data.  
3. **Severity Analysis**:  
   - Used predefined thresholds and custom algorithms to calculate infection severity for various weather scenarios.  
4. **Visualization**:  
   - Plotted incubation curves and severity trends to provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
